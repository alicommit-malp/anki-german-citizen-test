# Contents

`anki_decks/`

Import these decks into your Anki app.
 
Note: Only the base questions and the Berlin questions have been saved as decks.
 
Note: I did some manual polishing on these questions that you won't find in the CSV files.

`data/anki_with_images/`

Anki cards in CSV format. You can import these into Anki and turn them into decks.

For each question with an image attached, find the PNG image with the number of the question. 

You can load this image into your Anki card (you only need to do this once.)

`data/gesamtfragenkatalog-lebenindeutschland.pdf`

The official PDF data source.

# Disclaimers

I used the GPT API to extract the questions and derive the answers. While I found the cards to be generally accurate, I do not give any guarantees of correctness. Do your own research!

# Contact

Starting with just a PDF, I built an AI-powered workflow to:

* Transcribe the questions into a structured format
* Derive the correct answer for each question
* Generate clear explanations
* Format the data into Anki format
